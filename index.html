  Born in 1986. I am from that generation where childhood was pre-Internet but adolescence and adulthood hit at its rise and post.
The forms expression can take has cocained to overdose: blog, graphic, novel, poem, soap opera, opera, phone-in, reality TV, post-reality TV, talent show, article, essay, thesis, paper, film, advert, spam / email, comic, YouTube, maybe motivational lecture, spoken word, viral campaign, birthday card, rap battle, lyric, indie-folk, photograph, sculpture, Photoshop, ambient electronica, paint, oil, spray can, doodle, Comment is Free, Facebook status, Twitter, radio, play, opera, symphony, blues, etc., etc., snort, etc., not even including the catalogued works of histories creation, all now immediate as e-books and mp3s and torrents and one-click Amazon orders.
