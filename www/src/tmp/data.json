The bad guys you expect. The gangsters and the hoods with old axes to grind. They all come with the territory. But the heroes - them, you don't expect. Popping up to give you the eyeball and make sure you're toeing the line. Their line. Spider-Man and his wisecracks...Frank Castle, the angel of death himself, telling you he'll be keeping an eye on you...even the fugitive Captain America, with a word to say about crashing aircrafts into the sides of buildings in New York City. And now, this other thing. Someone is out there. Someone hitting the old haunts, scenes of the old crimes. Leaving messages. Leaving bodies. Someone who knows you. Someone who crushes steel and pulls off limbs. All to get your attention. Someone out of your league! Plus: Some people come to New York City looking for a knight in shining armor. Or just a warm body who can help you through the lonely hours. Be careful what you look for. Hot crime novelist Duane Swierczynski (The Blonde) and Jefte Paolo bring you the story of three women whose lives intersect in strange and deadly ways, two predators who stalk the city streets at night, and one shock ending you won't see coming.

For how long and to what extent, Tony Stark is not sure, but there is one thing he does know: Now is not the time for complacency. Following hot on the heels of the stunning revelation that Skrulls have been masquerading as Elektra and Black Bolt, Stark puts his best data-mining technology to the test to piece together their treacherous plot. From their first encounter with the Fantastic Four, through the epic clash of the Kree/Skrull War and the destruction of the Skrull Throne world, all the way to the recent Annihilation War and subsequent invasion of Earth, the timeline of known Skrull activity is made clear so effective battle plans can be drawn.

Now, as he meets with the uber-powerful elite of the Cabal - Doctor Doom, Loki and the Hood - the final stages of his Dark Reign are about to be put into fruition: the taking of Asgard. Some might say such a plan is insane. And when you're dealing with the former and possibly future Green Goblin, we're not going to necessarily disagree with you! SIEGE: STORMING ASGARD - HEROES & VILLIANS takes you inside the careful planning behind Osborn's crusade to take the kingdom of Thor off the board.

Captain America has been revealed to be an agent of Hydra – and he’s coming after Inhumans! S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Daisy Johnson, a.k.a. QUAKE, wants no part of Hydra, so she goes underground, teaming up with MS. MARVEL, MOON GIRL & DEVIL DINOSAUR, KARNAK and INFERNO to set things right – for the Inhumans, but also for the entire country! Penned by rising star Matthew Rosenberg (Kingpin, Rocket Raccoon, 4 Kids Walk Into A Bank) and drawn by the immensely talented Javier Garrón (Death of X, Inhumans vs X-Men), SECRET WARRIORS is one part coming-of-age story, one part spy-thriller, all action and all heart. Don’t miss the next (and final?) generation of Inhumans as they take the Marvel Universe by storm!","thumbnail":{"path":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/c/f0/5908c8beeb4b9","extension":"jpg"},"urls":[{"type":"detail","url":"http://marvel.com/comics/issue/62838/secret_warriors_2017_1?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=c34e462895a7a97d4da4435b7fd37c79"},{"type":"purchase","url":"http://comicstore.marvel.com/Secret-Warriors-1/digital-comic/44827?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=c34e462895a7a97d4da4435b7fd37c79"}],"dates":[{"type":"onsaleDate","date":"2017-05-10T00:00:00-0400"},{"type":"focDate","date":"2017-04-17T00:00:00-0400"}],"events":["336"],"characters":["1017583","1009385","1017577"]},{"id":"62839","title":"Secret Warriors  (2017) #2","description":"A SECRET EMPIRE TIE-IN!
